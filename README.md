## Building things
Right now, the CPU testbench and the assembler can be compiled. Just run the provided Makefiles in their respective directories.

To build the CPU testbench, you'll need make, Icarus Verilog, and ideally some sort of waveform viewer (like GTKWave).

To build spasm, you'll need g++, make, and libboost.
