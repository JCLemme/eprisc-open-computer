-------------------------

Registers

The CPU supports up to 224 32-bit registers, split into fourteen pages of sixteen registers each.
Implementations are not required to and likely will not implement all 224 registers. The contents and behavior of unimplemented register pages is undefined.
The last two register pages, pages hE and hF, are virtual; they exist to access system control registers.

The currently selected register page is mapped with the letters W, X, Y, and Z:

   w        x        y        z
W Ww (0)   Wx (1)   Wy (2)   Wz (3)
X Xw (4)   Xx (5)   Xy (6)   Xz (7)
Y Yw (8)   Yx (9)   Yy (10)  Yz (11)
Z Zw (12)  Zx (13)  Zy (14)  Zz (15)

Registers Ww, Wx, Wy, and Wz are special; they are mapped to system registers IP, SP, CS, and GL.

IP      Instruction Pointer     Current location of execution
SP      Stack Pointer           Current location of the top of the stack
CS      Core Status             Core status and control flags 
GL      Global Register         Maintains state throughout page changes

The IP register holds the current location of execution for the CPU. Relative addressing for branch, load, and store instructions can be achieved by using the IP register as their base address register.
The IP register should not be modified outside of a branch instruction. Write behavior for the IP register is undefined. 

The SP register is used to implement the CPU's stack. The stack grows up; pushed values increase the stack pointer and popped values decrease the stack pointer.
When used as the base address register of a load or store instruction, the SP register will automatically adjust to implement a push or pop.

The flags and fields of the CS register control CPU behavior.
Modified flags or fields take effect after the execution of the current instruction.

                    pppp                    Register Page field                     Sets the current register page.
                         llll               Global Link Register field              Sets the link register for branch instructions.
                              s             Hide Special Registers flag             When true, allows use of registers Ww through Wz as general purpose registers.
                               i            Enable Interrupts flag                  When true, allows use of interrupts.
                                x           ALU Sign Extension flag                 When true, performs sign extension on the value field of arithmetic instructions.
                                 f          Inhibit Flag Set flag                   When true, prevents instructions setting the carry, zero, negative, and overflow flags.
                                   cznv     Carry/Zero/Negative/Overflow flags      Flags set as the result of arithmetic instructions.

A number of race conditions can occur through accidental modification of the "Register Page" field and the "Hide Special Registers" flag of the CS register. 
Because of this, it is recommended to use the "Set Register Page" core instruction to alter these fields.

The GL register, as a system register, is not affected by register page changes. This makes it useful for moving values between registers in different register pages.
Otherwise, the GL register holds no special purpose.

-------------------------

Memory Access

As a RISC ISA, epRISC performs a maximum of one memory access per instruction. Only the load, store, and branch instructions access memory.
Low priority, medium priority, and software interrupts store their return address on the stack, and perform a memory access doing so.

-------------------------

Reset

Instruction execution begins at h00000000, the first location in memory.
All system registers (IP, SP, CS, and GL) are set to zero after reset. The reset value of all other registers is undefined.

-------------------------

Interrupts (basic)

The basic interrupt controller includes two hardware interrupts - one maskable and the other non-maskable.
The interrupt controller uses four registers, Xw through Xz, of register page hF for control.

IB      Interrupt Base          Base address for interrupt handlers.
IR      Interrupt Return        Three-level return stack for return addresses, with Xx at the top.

The maskable interrupt line calls address IB when it is triggered. The non-maskable interrupt calls IB+h80 when it is triggered.
Software interrupts call address IB+ID when called, where ID is the identifier provided to the software interrupt call.

The current location of execution is stored in the return stack, implemented from registers Xx through Xz of register page hF.
Register Xx is the top of the stack.

The maskable interrupts and software interrupts can be disabled by resetting the "Enable interrupts" flag of the CS register. This flag is automatically set when the maskable interrupt is triggered.
The non-maskable interrupt will always execute when triggered.

Interrupts can be returned from with a branch intstruction. Using this mode of the branch instruction will automatically branch to the return address and set the "Enable interrupts" flag of the CS register.

-------------------------

Instruction Set

Instruction words are broken up into six categories. The fields for each instruction category are listed below.
Generally, instructions will take some combination of single-bit flags, four-bit register IDs, and multi-bit values.
Fields labeled with "Reserved and unused" should be set to zero. Instruction behavior with non-zero values in these fields is undefined.


Branch instructions control program flow. They can take a condition code to create a conditional branch.

Load/store instructions manipulate values in memory, loading them into or storing them from the CPU's registers.

Core instructions control the CPU. They implement things like the no-operation instruction, the software interrupt instruction, and the halt instruction.

       oo oooo dddd dddd dddd dddd dddd     Operation/Data                          Operation to be performed and its data. See below.
               
                   
Branch instructions expect a three-bit type code that defines the behavior of the branch.
When the most significant bit of the code is zero, the branch behaves normally.
When the most significant bit of the code is one, the branch behaves as a call instruction, either saving or restoring the previous address of execution according to the two least significant bits.
A special case occurs when the MSB is zero, while the LSBs are both one; the branch will then attempt to return from an interrupt using the interrupt control registers and CS register.

b000    Branch                      Branches to the supplied address.
b100    Call, save link             Branches, saving the current location of execution to the link register set by the CS register.
b101    Call, save stack            Branches, saving the current location of execution to the stack.
b110    Call, restore link          Branches to the address stored in the link register set by the CS register.
b111    Call, restore stack         Branches to the address stored on the stack.
b011    Interrupt return            Branches either from the stack or an interrupt link register, performing priority restoration in the process.


Branch instructions also expect a four-bit condition code that defines when the branch should be performed.
Condition codes determine their result by querying the carry, zero, negative, and overflow flags of the CS register.
All sixteen possible condition codes are defined. The branch will execute when the chosen condition is true.

h00     Always True                 Always executes.
h01     Equal                       Executes if the zero flag is set.
h02     Not Equal                   Executes if the zero flag is reset.
h03     Higher or Same              Executes if the carry flag is set.
h04     Lower                       Executes if the carry flag is reset.
h05     Negative                    Executes if the negative flag is set.
h06     Positive or Zero            Executes if the negative flag is reset.
h07     Overflow                    Executes if the overflow flag is set.
h08     No Overflow                 Executes if the overflow flag is reset.
h09     Higher                      Executes if the carry flag is set and the zero flag is reset.
h0A     Lower or Same               Executes if the carry flag is reset or if zero flag is set.
h0B     Greater/Equal To            Executes if the negative and overflow flags are equal.
h0C     Less/Equal To               Executes if the negative and overflow flags are inequal.
h0D     Greater Than                Executes if the zero flag is reset and the negative and overflow flags are equal.
h0E     Less Than                   Executes if the zero flag is set or if the negative and zero flags are inequal.
h0F     Always False                Never executes.


Arithmetic instructions expect a five-bit opcode that defines the operation to be performed. 
Most arithmetic operations operate on two terms (A and B); however, some operations work on one term (A) or three terms (A, B, and V).
Only the first sixteen of these operations are currently defined.

h00     Add                         (a + b)
h01     Subtract                    (a - b)
h02     Bitwise AND                 (a & b)
h03     Bitwise OR                  (a | b)
h04     Bitwise XOR                 (a ^ b)
h05     Bitwise NOT                 (~a)
h06     Arithmetic Shift Left       (a << b)
h07     Arithmetic Shift Right      (a >> b)
h08     Logical Shift Right         (a >> b) without sign extension
h09     Rotate Left                 (a r< b)
h0A     Rotate Right                (a r> b)
h0B     Inverse Mask                (a & ~b)
h0C     Mask and Shift Left         ((a & v) << s) or ((a & v) << b)  
h0D     Mask and Shift Right        ((a & v) >> s) or ((a & v) >> b)
h0E     Compare                     (a - b) without result store
h0F     Test                        (a & b) without result store


Core instructions expect a six-bit opcode that defines the operation to be performed, along with a twenty-bit data field.
Only the first four of these operations are currently defined.

h00     No Operation                iiii iiii iiii iiii iiii    Reserved and unused
h01     Software Interrupt          dddd dddd iiii iiii iiii    Interrupt ID (8-bit, +256)/Reserved and unused
