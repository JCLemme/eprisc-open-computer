-------------------------

Overview

The sysX bus is a full-duplex and synchronous data transmission bus. It is similar in operation to the SPI bus. 
Make this better later.

-------------------------

Electrical

The sysX bus uses four distinct signals to transmit data: SCLK, MISO, MOSI, and CS.

SCLK    Slave clock                 Clock for slave devices. Controlled by the bus master.
MISO    Master in, slave out        Data from the selected slave device to the bus master.
MOSI    Master out, slave in        Data from the bus master to the selected slave device.
CS      Chip select                 Selection

Patterns of things:
CS changes to desired device
Receive on falling edge
Place on rising edge
Host starts placing on first rising edge after CS

R CS change to active device
F
R Host places high
F Device reads high
R Host places low
F Device reads high
R CS change to loopback
F
