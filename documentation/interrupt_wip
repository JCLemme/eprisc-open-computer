Interrupts

Interrupts are split into four priority levels - low, medium, high, and critical.

The handler address called on an interrupt is created by adding the priority of the interrupt (zero through three) to the handler base address.
Software interrupts have their eight-bit interrupt ID added to the handler base address in the same way; because of this, software interrupts zero through three correspond to hardware interrupts low through critical.

Low priority, medium priority, and software interrupts store their return address on the stack. 
High and critical priority interrupts store their return address in their respective link registers, to avoid a memory access.

The interrupt control system utilizes four control registers, mapped to Xw through Xz of register page hF.

HB  Handler Base            Base address for interrupt handlers.
PS  Priority Stack          Single-word stack used to store pushed priority settings. 
LH  Link High               Link register for high priority interrupt calls.
LC  Link Critical           Link register for critical priority interrupt calls.

The handler base address has two modes, controlled by the "Wide handlers" flag of the CS register.
When wide handlers are disabled, the address called when an interrupt is called will equal the interrupt priority or ID plus the base address.
When wide handlers are enabled, hardware interrupt priorities are multiplied by 32. This leaves a 32-word space for each interrupt priority in the interrupt table for implementation of interrupt handlers. 
This space allows removing the second jump to an interrupt handler, speeding up interrupt service. However, it prevents access to software interrupts below 128.

The priority stack allows correct priority restoration when returning from an interrupt. 
When an interrupt is called, the current priority setting is pushed to the rightmost side of the stack word, left shifting the rest of the word in the process.
The current priority setting is then replaced with the one that blocks the level of the interrupt called.
When returning from an interrupt, the last pushed priority setting is popped from the same side and replaces the current priority setting, and the rest of the word is right shifted.

Interrupt priorities control which interrupts are blocked, rather than which are allowed, in an "equal or greater" fashion.
The "Force Critical Interrupts" flag of the CS register prevents blocking of critical interrupts.  
 
b00     Block Low                   Block low, medium, high, and critical priority interrupts.
b01     Block Medium                Block medium, high, and critical priority interrupts.
b10     Block High                  Block high and critical priority interrupts.
b11     Block Critical              Block critical priority interrupts.

Branch instructions are used to return from interrupts. These returns will automatically restore the previous priority setting and load the return address from the correct source.

Interrupts are split into sixteen priority levels, with fifteen being the lowest priority and zero being the highest.
When the controller is enabled, interrupts will be serviced on a highest-priority basis, with the ability for higher priority interrupts to pause execution of lower-priority interrupts.

Interrupts are level-triggered by default. This can be changed on a per-interrupt basis by altering the Trigger field of the EC register.
Interrupts can be individually enabled and disabled by altering the Enable field of the EC register.
The global Interrupt Enable flag of the CS register is respected by the interrupt controller - when this flag is set, no interrupts will be serviced.
When an interrupt is called, the previous address of execution and priority level are pushed to an internal return stack.
The branch instruction uses this stack in Interrupt mode to return from an interrupt and restore the priority level.


The interrupt control system utilizes four control registers, mapped to Xw through Xz of register page hF.

IC      Interrupt Control           Control register for the interrupt controller.
EC      Enable Control              Enable state and triggering settings for interrupts.
HB      Hardware Base               Base address for hardware interrupts.
SB      Software Base               Base address for software interrupts.

The IC register holds configuration data for the interrupt controller.
