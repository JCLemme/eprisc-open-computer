-----

* What does it cost to use the epRISC ISA/sysX protocol/other epRISC technology?

- Nothing. All epRISC project hardware is free for any use, including commercial, research, and educational uses. 


* Do we have to release the source to our implementation of an epRISC technology?

- No - all implementations created by you belong to you, and can be licensed any way you would like. This excludes implementations that are directly derived from the example implementations
